//Write a function that receives a number and prints as a result that number multiplied by two

function solve(number){
    //input a number ... this instance is 2
    console.log(number * 2);
    //output a number ... times it by 2 to get the number * 2 = 4
}

solve(2);


// this is another way to write this function                                               
//function solve(number){
//    let n = number * 2;
//    console.log(n);
//}
