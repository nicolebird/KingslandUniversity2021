//Write a function that receives list of neighborhoods and then some people, who are going to live in it.  The input will come as array of strings.  The first element will be list of neighborhoods separated by ",".  The rest of the elements will be a neighborhood followed by a name of a person in the format "{neighborhood} - {person}".  Add the person to the neighborhood only if the neighborhood is in the list of neighborhoods.  At the end print the neighborhoods sorted by the count of inhabitants in descending order.  Print them in the following format:  "{neighborhood} : {inhabitants count}  -- {1st inhabitants}  -- {2nd inhabitant}"

//INPUT [`Abbey Street, Herald Street, Bright Mews`, 'Bright Mews - Garry`, `Bright Mews - Andrea`, `Invalid Street - Tommy`, `Abbey Street - Billy`]

//HINTS:  1)Save the first element of the array as the neighborhoods  2)Fill the map with the and their set values as empty arrays  3) Loop through the rest of the elements  4) Check if the neighborhood is in the list/mao and add the person 5)Sort them by count of inhabitants  6)Print
