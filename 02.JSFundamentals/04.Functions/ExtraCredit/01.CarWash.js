//Write a JS function that receives some commands.  Depending on the command add a percentage to how much of the car is cleaned.  Start from 0.  The first command will always be  `soap`:
//soap -> adds 10 to the value
//water -> increase that value with 20%
//vacuum cleaner -> increase the value with 25%
//mud -> decrease the value with 10%

//The input comes as an array of strings.  When finished cleaning the car, print the resulting value in the format: `The car is {value}% clean.`
//The value should be rounded to the second decimal point.
