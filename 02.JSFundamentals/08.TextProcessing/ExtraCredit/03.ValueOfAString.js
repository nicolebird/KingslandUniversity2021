//TODO: THIS CODE IS WRONG BUT I AM WORKING ON FIGURING IT OUT
//Write a function which finds the sum of the ASCII codes of the letters in a given string.  Your task will be a bit harder, because you will have to find the sum of either lowercase or uppercase letters.

//On the first line, you will receive a string

//On the second line, you will receive one of the two possible inputs:
////// if you receive "UPPERCASE" -> find the sum of all uppercase English letters in the previously received string
////// if you receive "LOWERCASE" -> find the sum of all lowercase English letters in the previously receieved string

//You should not sum the ASCII codes of any characters, which are not letters.
//At the end print the sum in the following format:
//// The total sum is : {sum}

function main(sum){
    if(string == uppercase){
        console.log(`The total sum is: ${sum}`);
    }
    if(string == lowercase){
        console.log(`The total sum is: ${sum}`);
    }
}


main(`HelloFromMyAwesomePROGRAMLOWERCASE`);
main(`AC/DC UPPERCASE`);
