//this code required the function main in the HW grader

//Write a program that prints the numbers in the range \[1...1000\], which end in 7 (hence the console log sevens)
//Print the numbers on a single line, separated by a single space

//Not sure why this example contained no input but the output was 7 17 27 -> 997
